        Variants of accuracy and precision are the gold-standard by which the computer vision community measures progress of perception algorithms. One reason for the ubiquity of these metrics is that they are largely task-agnostic; we in general seek to detect zero false negatives or positives. The downside of these metrics is that, at worst, they penalize all incorrect detections equally without conditioning on the task or scene, and at best, heuristics need to be chosen to ensure that different mistakes count differently. In this paper, we propose a principled metric for 3D object detection specifically for the task of self-driving. The core idea behind our metric is to isolate the task of object detection and measure the impact the produced detections would induce on the downstream task of driving. Without hand-designing it to, we find that our metric penalizes many of the mistakes that other metrics penalize by design. In addition, our metric downweighs detections based on additional factors such as distance from a detection to the ego car and the speed of the detection in intuitive ways that other detection metrics do not. For human evaluation, we generate scenes in which standard metrics and our metric disagree and find that humans side with our metric 79% of the time.

        <!-- The computer vision community generally seeks to maximize the <b>accuracy</b> and <b>precision</b> of its algorithms. The downside of these metrics is that they are <b>task agnostic</b>. For instance, a perception algorithm that always misdetects cars that are right in front of the ego car will be penalized just as much as a perception algorithm that misdetects cars 50 meters behind the ego car. This mismatch between rankings induced by naive accuracy and precision versus human intuition about driving safety can have serious consequences when determining which perception algorithms are ready to be deployed.

        We propose a <b>task aware</b> metric for perception specifically for the task of self-driving. The core idea behind our metric is to isolate the task of object detection and measure the impact the produced detections would induce on the downstream task of driving. Without hand-designing it to, we find that our metric penalizes many of the mistakes that other metrics penalize by design. In addition, our metric downweights detections based on additional factors such as distance from a detection to the ego car and the speed of the detection in intuitive ways that other detection metrics do not. For human evaluation, we generate scenes in which standard metrics and our metric disagree and find that <b>humans agree with our metric 80% of the time</b>. We plan to release a publicly available server for evaluating 3D object detectors using our metrics with the aim to better judge readiness of current detectors for deployment on real self-driving platforms.
        <br>

        Below, we show under "<b>AMT Survey</b>" a pair of noisy detections for which the rankings induced by AP versus NDS (ours) is opposite.

    <h4 class='text-center'>Synopsis of Results</h4>

    <b>Human evaluation</b> We generate pairs of detection mistakes such that, for every pair, NDS ranks one set of detection mistakes worse but PKL considers the other set of detection mistakes worse. We then ask humans to choose which mistake was more dangerous. We find that in 79% of the generated scenarios, the humans side with our metric, PKL.

    <p><b>Comparison to hand-designed metrics</b> On the left, we show that PKL largely agrees with NDS under canonical noise models such as translation error. On the right, we show that while NDS penalizes false negatives equally independent of context, PKL penalizes false negatives more strongly if the missed detection is close to the ego vehicle or moving at high speeds.</p>

    <p><b>False Negative/False Positive Sensitivity</b> We visualize the "importance" that each true object in the scene is detected correctly by removing each object from the scene and re-evaluating the PKL (left). The ego vehicle is shown in green. To visualize the sensitivity of PKL to false positives, we place false positives at each position on a grid local to the ego vehicle and evaluate the PKL (right). Qualitatively, the "worst" false negatives involve objects that are close to the ego vehicle and the "worst" false positives occur in regions where the  ego vehicle is likely to travel in the future.</p>
